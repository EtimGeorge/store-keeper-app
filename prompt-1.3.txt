Excellent. Our web app now displays a beautiful, responsive login screen. The separation of concerns is clear: HTML is generated by JavaScript "view" functions, and CSS handles the styling.

Now, let's wire up the "LOGIN" button to Firebase Authentication. This step will bring our form to life.

Operator, here is your next assignment.

Your workflow:

Feed this prompt to the AI builder.

Review the AI's output. It should provide a new event listener for js/auth.js.

Integrate the new code into your project. You will be adding to js/auth.js.

To test this, you must first go to your Firebase Console:

Navigate to the Authentication section.

Go to the "Sign-in method" tab and enable the Email/Password provider.

Go to the "Users" tab and click "Add user". Create a test user (e.g., test@example.com with password password123).

Refresh your app. Enter the test user's credentials and click LOGIN.

Open the browser console (F12). You should see the User object logged upon successful login.

If you enter wrong credentials, you should see the error message displayed on the screen, and a FirebaseError object logged in the console.

Commit the verified code to your Git repository with the message: feat: Implement Firebase email/password login.

Confirm back to me when you are ready to handle the auth state changes (i.e., show a different screen after login).

Prompt 1.3 (Web Edition): Implement Login Functionality

[CONTEXT]
We are successfully rendering the login screen using the renderLoginScreen() function in js/auth.js. The form has an ID of login-form. The auth object (from firebase.auth()) is globally available from js/app.js.

[OBJECTIVE]
Add a JavaScript event listener to the login form. When the form is submitted, it should take the email and password from the input fields, send them to Firebase for authentication, and handle both success and error responses.

[INSTRUCTIONS]

Modify js/auth.js:

At the end of the renderLoginScreen() function, after setting the innerHTML, add the logic to attach an event listener to the form.

Select the form using document.getElementById('login-form').

Add a 'submit' event listener to it.

Inside the Event Listener:

Call event.preventDefault() to stop the default browser form submission behavior.

Get the values from the email and password input fields (#login-email and #login-password).

Select the error message element (#login-error) and clear its text content.

Call the Firebase authentication function: auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).

Handle the Response (Promise):

Use a .then() block for successful login. Inside, console.log('Login successful:', userCredential.user);. For now, we will just log the success.

Use a .catch() block for errors. Inside, console.error('Login failed:', error);. Then, display a user-friendly error message in the #login-error paragraph element (e.g., error.message).

[DELIVERABLES]

You will append this code to the end of the renderLoginScreen() function in js/auth.js:

Generated javascript
// --- Start of new code to be appended ---

  // Add event listener to the form
  const loginForm = document.getElementById('login-form');
  loginForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent page reload

    // Get user input
    const email = document.getElementById('login-email').value;
    const password = document.getElementById('login-password').value;
    const errorElement = document.getElementById('login-error');

    // Clear previous errors
    errorElement.textContent = '';

    // Sign in with Firebase
    auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
      .then((userCredential) => {
        // Signed in
        console.log('Login successful:', userCredential.user);
        // We will navigate to the home screen in the next step.
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Login failed:', error);
        // Display a user-friendly error message
        switch (error.code) {
          case 'auth/user-not-found':
          case 'auth/wrong-password':
            errorElement.textContent = 'Invalid email or password. Please try again.';
            break;
          case 'auth/invalid-email':
            errorElement.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address.';
            break;
          default:
            errorElement.textContent = 'An unknown error occurred. Please try again later.';
            break;
        }
      });
  });
  // --- End of new code to be appended ---


[ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECK]

Do not modify the HTML string.

The event listener must be added after the innerHTML is set, otherwise the form won't exist in the DOM yet.

Use the existing auth constant which was defined in app.js. Do not re-initialize it.

Handle both the success .then() and failure .catch() cases of the promise.

Awaiting your confirmation to proceed.
