Excellent. The login functionality is now working. We can successfully authenticate a user against Firebase. However, upon successful login, the user is still stuck on the login screen.

Our next task is to create the main "wrapper" logic that listens for authentication state changes. This is the cornerstone of a single-page application (SPA). It will automatically switch the view from the login screen to the main application screen when a user logs in, and back again when they log out.

Operator, here is your next assignment.

Your workflow:

Feed this prompt to the AI builder.

Review the AI's output carefully. It will modify js/app.js and js/auth.js, and create a new file, js/home.js.

Integrate the new code into your project. Remember to add the <script> tag for the new home.js file in your index.html.

Refresh your app.

Test Case 1 (Logged Out): The app should load and display the login screen as before.

Test Case 2 (Logging In): Log in with your test user. The screen should now automatically change to a simple page that says "Welcome, [user's email]". The console should log "Auth state changed: User is signed in."

Test Case 3 (Already Logged In): Refresh the page. The app should briefly show a blank screen (or a loading indicator we will add later) and then go directly to the "Welcome..." page, bypassing the login screen completely because Firebase remembers the user's session.

Commit the verified code to your Git repository with the message: feat: Implement auth state listener and home screen view.

Prompt 1.4 (Web Edition): Auth State Listener & Home Screen

[CONTEXT]
Currently, js/app.js renders the login screen when the DOM content is loaded. The login function in js/auth.js authenticates the user but does nothing visually upon success.

[OBJECTIVE]
Implement Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener. This listener will be the central router for our application. If a user is logged in, it will render the home screen; otherwise, it will render the login screen. We will also create a simple placeholder home screen and a logout button.

[INSTRUCTIONS]

Create js/home.js:

Create a new file at this path.

Inside, create a function renderHomeScreen(user). This function will take the Firebase user object as an argument.

It should generate HTML for a basic home screen, including a welcome message and a logout button. Use the user's email in the welcome message.

The function should set the innerHTML of the #app-container.

After setting the HTML, add an event listener to the logout button (#logout-btn) that calls auth.signOut().

Modify js/auth.js:

Remove the console.log from the .then() block of the signInWithEmailAndPassword function. We no longer need it because the onAuthStateChanged listener will handle the success case automatically.

Modify js/app.js:

Remove the DOMContentLoaded event listener that calls renderLoginScreen().

Replace it with the auth.onAuthStateChanged() listener.

Inside the listener's callback, you will receive a user object.

Use an if statement:

if (user): The user is signed in. Log "Auth state changed: User is signed in." to the console and call renderHomeScreen(user).

else: The user is signed out. Log "Auth state changed: User is signed out." to the console and call renderLoginScreen().

Modify index.html:

Add a script tag for our new js/home.js file. Place it before the other custom script tags.

Generated html
<!-- Our Scripts -->
<script src="js/home.js"></script>
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/app.js"></script>


[DELIVERABLES]

1. Complete code for the new file js/home.js:

Generated javascript
function renderHomeScreen(user) {
  const appContainer = document.getElementById('app-container');

  const homeHtml = `
    <div class="main-container">
      <div class="header">
        <h2>Store Keeper</h2>
        <button id="logout-btn" class="btn btn-secondary">Logout</button>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Welcome, ${user.email}!</h3>
        <p>This is your main dashboard. Inventory and sales features will appear here.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  `;

  appContainer.innerHTML = homeHtml;

  // Add event listener for the logout button
  const logoutButton = document.getElementById('logout-btn');
  logoutButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    auth.signOut().then(() => {
      console.log('User signed out successfully.');
      // onAuthStateChanged will handle re-rendering the login screen
    }).catch((error) => {
      console.error('Sign out error', error);
    });
  });

2. Updated code for js/app.js (replace the entire file's content):

Generated javascript
// TODO: Replace with your app's Firebase project configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

// Initialize Firebase
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Initialize Firebase services
const auth = firebase.auth();
const db = firebase.firestore();

// Main app router
auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('Auth state changed: User is signed in.', user);
    renderHomeScreen(user);
  } else {
    // User is signed out.
    console.log('Auth state changed: User is signed out.');
    renderLoginScreen();
  }
});

3. Small change for js/auth.js:

In the signInWithEmailAndPassword function, the .then() block should now be empty.

Generated javascript
// Inside the submit event listener...
auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .then((userCredential) => {
    // SUCCESS! onAuthStateChanged will handle the navigation.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // ... (error handling remains the same)
  });

4. Additional CSS for css/style.css (append this):

Generated css
.main-container {
  padding: 1rem;
}

.header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
  padding-bottom: 1rem;
}

.header h2 {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.btn-secondary {
  background-color: #6c757d;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}

.btn-secondary:hover {
  background-color: #5a6268;
}

.content {
  padding-top: 1rem;
}

[ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECK]

The onAuthStateChanged listener in app.js must be the only top-level code that runs. All view rendering decisions must flow from it.

The renderHomeScreen function must accept the user object as a parameter to display personalized content.

Ensure the logout button is wired up correctly to auth.signOut().

Awaiting your confirmation to proceed.
